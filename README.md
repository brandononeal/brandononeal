*Hey there! I'm Brandon.*

I am passionate about software development and helping people achieve their goals. I recently graduated from BloomTech's full-stack web development program. During that time, I was a peer mentor to other students and worked with the nonprofit organization Family Promise to develop their shelter management system.
