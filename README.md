*Hey there! I'm Brandon.*

I have a passion for software development and helping people achieve their personal and professional goals. I recently graduated from BloomTech's nine-month immersive Full Stack Web Development program. During that time, I served as a peer mentor to other students and worked with the nonprofit organization Family Promise to develop their shelter management system and service tracker.
